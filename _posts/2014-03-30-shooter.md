I woke up, got dressed, and walked into the kitchen.

John already washed his dishes, set the coffee on the brewer. The bagel was already in the toaster.

I poured myself a cup of coffee, start toasting the bagel, sat down at the table, started to read the book left open on the table.

The book is called The Alchemist. It's a story about a boy Santiago who longs to travel the world. Much like John and myself, we move from place to place, although rarely intended.

 
I stopped my car by the almost empty basketball court. I sat down at the bench, took my time to eat my bagel and read some more of that book.

Only one boy was there shooting. He was shooting as if nothing else in the world was there, as if it was the only thing that matters at all. As if he was in a complete solitude --- and he shoots as he if he didn't care about that at all.

About a dozen pages after, I'm done with my bagel. I walked to John. He passed me the ball and I would pass it back. He could then practice some catch and shoot.

It's all about fundamentals: catch the ball at the right rhythm, prepare the ball to shoot the same shot every time. Split the feet, bend the knees the right. Elevate from the ground through the leg and the waist and the back --- relax, un-stiff, then release it through the arm, the wrist, the finger tip. Everything should be in one motion, as if you just jump, and the ball shoot itself.

We rarely talk during all this. The fundamentals being fundamentals, meaning that you should know when something was incorrect, not through conscious, but through how the body felt. It just feels wrong.

John spent many early mornings and late nights shooting. He would be in all solitude, the only man among the street lights and the rims. He would shoot the ball as if he was communicating to the rim, not through speech, but through shots. He would communicate they way people talk to old friends. He might be just a boy and shooting all alone, but he's never lonely.

We shot about fifty jumpers that morning, I threw him the jumper shirt and then drove him to school.

 

John took very little time for his age to got use to the type of life that involved constantly moving. Having a mechanic job in the air force, moving is part of the job. This is tough for the children. They usually end up moving just about the time they got to know other kids at school.

Therefore, John picked friends to spend time with who will move with him: the rim, and books.

When he got the chance to play with other kids, he always took the strongest kid that no one else wanted. He would be thrown on the ground, he would just pat the dust out and keep going.

"He's a good kid, I will take him." The school basketball team's coach agreed to took him the first time he saw him.

"I've seen that kind of kid before." said the coach: "He's fearless. He would do anything to stay on the court, and only the winner got to stay on the court. I liked that."

I suppose he's right, when you can handle solitude, there's not that many things left to fear.

 

On our way driving to school, I asked: "So the game is today?"

"Yeah." John answered without moving his eyes away from the book.

"Who are you playing?"

John said a name.

That school had a well known basketball program around the area. Very well trained and coached, they might compete for a championships title.

"Nervous?"

"No." He answered without haste.

"Play defense, leave the rest to Joe, we'll be alright."

"What kind of sets do you guys run?" I asked.

I saw through the Rear-view mirror that John put both his index fingers on the top his head, as if they are the horns of an ox.

"Draw it to me." I park the car by the side of the road.

John took out a pen and a piece of paper, quickly drew some diagrams on it.

I had a quick glance, drew another one and handed it back to him.

John stared at it for a bit.

"Get it?"

He nodded.

"But the ball won't be here." He then pointed at one place on the paper: "Joe will keep the ball."

"The ball will be there." I looked into John's eye: "Joe is a good kid, the ball will be there."

 

John never said another word on the way, he wasn't reading that book either.

We arrived. John jumped off the car.

"You forgot this." I passed him the paper.

He took it, turned and running into school.

 

By the time I finished the day's work, it was almost ten.

All the engines piled up, fixing them felt like eternity.

By the time I walked into the gym, only couple of minutes were left to the game.

It wouldn't take anybody much time to realize who everybody was there to watch. Joe was really something special. He would run through the crowd and lay the ball into basket from the most unpredictable angles. The way he sprint the court, he split into every impossible gap carried a certain elegance that you rarely resembled on teenage boys. It almost as if he was performing a dance, while every body else on the court was hustling out a sport.

The girls would cheer every time Joe catch the ball. What they wouldn't realize was that their star was very exhausted at this point. This was a game between the hunters and a deer. Both parties were running out of breath. Consider the number of hunters and there was only one deer, the game was surprisingly close.

Then would be the moment every kid ever played basketball dream about: last minute of the game, the super star dribble the ball over the court, points his finger on a certain spot and tell the defender he would shoot the buzzer beater right there, and deliver ed exactly that.

In that imagination, the star would distinguish himself among every body else with a halo. He would catch the ball the way warrior in the tales taking over the sword to slay the dragon. He would catch it, square up, jump and shoot it with a soft release like a lover's touch. The ball would draw a beautiful curve, touching nothing but the net, and tear the heart out of every opponent.

John would never thought about that.

He was facing the best player of the opposing team, sweat flow though his body as if it was gliding through ice. John could not jump or run, and he would never be the focus on the court. All he could do, was to put his body on the player he was guarding, who had at least 20 pounds on him.

And that was exactly what he did.

John could barely kept his feet on the floor, but he managed to forced the opponent dribbled the ball into a corner, where there would be a trap waiting.

Joe took him by surprise. He stripped off the ball and started dibbling over half court.

There was less then a minute left. The coach was waving his hand  and yelling. But his voice immediately devoured by the noise of the crowd. Joe saw the two fingers the coach reached out of his fist, he tried to yell something to his teammate, but none was heard.

He then puts both of his index finger on the top of his head, like the horns of an ox.

John was waiting in the corner already.

Joe cut to the corner, setting a screen for John, who would to cut the other side. 

Everybody else was supposed to clear out the floor. Seats would be ready, the stage would be set, everything for the finale of the show.

He would then move back up to the top, taking the enemy one on one, like the old style heroes in the black and white TV.

 

What he didn't realize, was that the hunt has yet finished. It wouldn't take too much intelligent to know the game would boil down to the discipline of a team versus the talent of one player. Everybody in the gym knew the ball would be back into Joe's hands. The hunt ends here: the hunters' attempt to deceive the deer so it believed that it had escape the hunt, while the last trap was just ahead.

When the deer realized what the hunters were doing, he was already surrounded by three people. Joe could feel the breath and the sweat of the hunters. They had been chasing him the whole game and this time they finally trapped him.

The cage forged by six arms was crushing on him. Joe knew he would have to make a decision. Now would be a time for a hero, that might as well be him.

 

Later in his life, Joe watched the tape of that game many times. What he never quite figured out was that why that quiet transfer student all of a sudden made a different play. By the time he was surrounded, that kid silently move into the spot where he would have all the solitude of the world.

That night after the game, I ended up drove John to the shore before we went back home. John talked a lot, about other things, about that game. He talked about that that moment that he caught the ball, how that he never really thought about the ball or the shooting, how that his mind was clear, how there was no longer the game or the stadium or crowd. There was just him and the rim, an old friend, much like the rest of the days: a quiet boy, street lamps of the early mornings and the late nights, how an old friend never let you down.

"It's called enlightened." John said. He said he read that from a book.

I suppose he was right.
