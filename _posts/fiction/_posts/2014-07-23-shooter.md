A man and a boy came out of a gym, it was late and every one had left. In the day time it was hot and humid and dusty but at night the air carried a sweet smell and things starts to settle down.

"Do you want some ice cream?" the man asked.

"No."

"What about a walk?"

"I don't want to. I'm tired." said the boy, the he sat down at the stairs. So the man sat down with him.

"That was a good game." the man said.

"I guess."

"It was, that I'm sure." said the man. "some real nice shots too."

"One of them, I guess."

"No, one of them was _especially_ nice." answered the man.

"Just when did you arrive?"

"About 10 minutes left in the second half."

"Work?"

"Yeah, a lot of work." the man said. The boy saw the signs of oils on the man, he could also smile machines from him.

"At least you made it this time."

"Saw some good stuff too."

"Joe? He was pretty amazing."

"Wasn't the only good thing I saw."

"Those guys played well, they should have win."

"Well trained, a little luck might have changed the whole thing."

"They say Joe will be a star, may even play in the NBA one day."

"I'd believe that. He is a special kid. Everybody else come to see him." the man said.

It was dark and the night was tender. The gym was crowded a while ago and was now completely empty without sight of a man. They sat in the shadow made by a tree with a eletric light shone a gentle, orange light on it. There was a road in front of them and a car passed by, soon vanished in the sight, and it was complete silence.

"Coach said if we play defence, the game will take care of itself."

"And you think he meant if you played defence, _Joe_ would take care the game." the man said to the boy."Well, he wasn't right this time. _Someone else_ took care of it." 

A brief smile appeared on the boy's face and neither of them talked for a while, util man thought of something and asked:

"How was that book you are reading?"

"_The Alchemist_?"

"Yes. What was it about again?"

"A kid who traveled the world. I like it."

"Much like we do, travel the world. Just how many places we moved in the last few years?"

"First north California, then Germany, Oklahoma, then England." said the boy.

"Then back to California, then to here. That was a lot of airforce bases." said the man.

"After all those, you are a big boy and can manage yourself now."

"I'm not sure if I could."

"You even took care of me now." said the man. "You bought groceries this morning before you left to shoot, you even managed to made me breakfast."

The boy answered with a smile.

"All these moving around and work aren't easy, so I appreciated the help." the man said. "Did you shoot well this morning?"

"Usual."

"That's good then."

"What is?"

"The morning shots. You usually shot well don't you?"

"I guess."

"Were you thinking you are going to make a big shot tonight? Like the one you did?"

"No." said the boy. "I didn't even know I could play."

"Of course you will play, you practiced all the time."

"Why? I'm new here, and the coach doesn't know I practice every morning."

"You praticed hard and you shoot well." asked the man. "Have some faith."

"But I didn't even _know_ I would play."

"That's why it's called faith." said the man. "It's believing it when you don't know for sure."

"How could I believe, if I do not know?"

"What one could know is little, while what one can do is far more." said the man.

"You shoot every morning, and you shoot well anywhere we go for as long as I can remember." said the man.

"Nobody knows if the ball is going in util it goes in, but if you shoot every morning and you shoot well, you should believe it's going in." said the man. "This is how you achieve beyond you know."

"Plus, Joe had faith in you." said the man.

"How?" asked the boy.

"He passed the ball to you didn't he?"

"But I was open. I remembered what you told me, that if I go there I would get open." said the boy. "How did you know I would get open that way?"

"I didn't. I had faith in the coach. He will call the right move. I knew him from before and he always does. And it's easy to get man open if you have a player like Joe." said the man. "I don't know that for sure, I just believed so."

"... I guess."

"Joe is a good kid. He is good kid because he had faith in himself that he would draw the defence to him; because he had faith in the coach drawing the right play; because he had faith in you making the open shot."

"We all had faith, and you should too."

"I see."

The night became very quiet, not much can be heard other than sound of the summer insects. The man stood up and look to the sky, it was a night without stars.

"So does it feel like catching the ball the heat of the moment like that?" can't seems to find any stars, the man then looked down and asked.

"Not much, really."

"There were a lot of people and noise and very little time."

"It wasn't that different from any other shots in the morning." said the boy, trying to recall the moment. "But somehow I felt the gym wasn't there anymore, the crowd wasn't there, not even teammates or opponent. There was just me and basket. Maybe not even the bastket"

"Solitary." Said the man.

"I felt a lot of things, but then not much at all. My head was very clear." said the boy. "I think in the book, they called it _enlightened_".

The night got hotter, as the boy stood up, trying to cath some breeze.

"Want some ice cream now?" asked the man.

"I'm worried they'll be bad for me."

"Drinking is bad for you, but when you had a especially good day, or a especially bad one, you could always have some ice cream" said the man.

"Like today." said the boy.

"You are young, hardworking and you can shoot pretty jump shots, with some faith and you will have everything. Everyday will be a good day." the man said. "Also, today _is_ a good day. I had a good day's work and you played a good game, made a good shot, and your team won. We could have some ice cream for that."

"Are there any ice cream shop open? It's late."

"There must be. We will find it and have ice cream. Tomorrow I will wake up the same way and work, you will wake up the same way and shoot. I know I would, I know you will." said the man. "I have faith in that."

"Come one, let's go get some ice cream." said the man, standing up, walking to his car.
