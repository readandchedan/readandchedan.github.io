A man and a boy walked out of the gym. It was dark and the night was tender. The daytime was hot, humid and dusty in day time but now things started to settle down and the air carried a sweet smell. It was late and every one had left. The gym was crowded but now without sight of any man other than man and boy came out from it. They stopped in the shadow made by a tree with a electric light shone a gentle, orange light over it. In front of them here is a road, a car passed by and soon vanished. Then it was complete silence.

"Do you want some ice cream?" the man asked.

"No."

"Why not, it's hot. What about a walk?"

"I'm tired." said the boy. He sat down at the stairs and the man sat down with him.

"That was a good game." the man said.

"I guess."

"It was, that I'm sure." said the man. "some real nice shots."

"Maybe One of them."

"No, one of them was _especially_ nice." answered the man.

"Just when did you arrive?"

"About 10 minutes left in the second half."

"Work?"

"Yeah, a lot of work." the man said. The boy could see the oil stains on him and smell the scent of machines.

"At least you made it this time."

"Saw some good stuff too."

"Joe was pretty amazing."

"Wasn't the only good thing I saw."

"Those guys played well, they should have win."

"Well trained. With a little luck this could be a different story." said the man.

"They say Joe will make it to the NBA one day."

"Yeah, maybe. Special kid. Every other guy come to watch him." the man said.

"Coach said if we play defence, the game will take care of itself."

"And you think he meant _Joe_ would take care of the game." the man said to the boy."Well, he got it all wrong this time. _Someone else_ made the shot and took care of the game." 

"It doesn't matter who made the shot, if it wasn't Joe no way that could happen." said the boy.

"A made shot is a made shot." said the man. "How's that book you are reading?"

"_The Alchemist_? I like it"

"What was it about?"

"A kid following his dream, traveled around the world ."

"Kinda like we do, just that none of us had any dreams to chance last time I check." said the man. "Just how many places we moved in the last few years?"

"First Castle in north California , then Ramstien in Germany, Atlus in Oklahoma, then  Bentwaters in England." said the boy.

"Then back to California at Edward, then to here at Shaw." said the man. "Well, that's a lot of air bases. At least you are a big boy now. You can manage yourself."

"Maybe."

"You even took care of me." said the man. "You bought groceries this morning before you left to shoot, you even made me breakfast."

The boy smiled briefly and silently.

"All these moving around and working aren't easy and I appreciated the help." the man said. "How's your shooting this morning?"

"Usual."

"That's good."

"What is?"

"The shooting. You usually shot well don't you?"

"I guess."

"Were you thinking about making big shots tonight?"

"No." said the boy. "I didn't even know I could play."

"Of course you will play, you practiced hard."

"I'm new here, coach doesn't know me."

"Have some faith. You practiced hard and you shoot well." asked the man. "You can play ball."

"But I just didn't _know_ I will play."

"That's why it's called faith." said the man. "It's believing it when you don't know for sure."

"But what difference does it make? Say I believed it, then what? We will move, and things come back to where it was."

"You worked hard on it and you shoot well, that doesn't change wherever we go." said the man.

"If we move, nobody would know me and my name won't be called. I can shoot I can't shoot, no difference when you can't play."

"You played hard and shoot well, I don't see why you can't play anywhere."

"Because I will be new and nobody will trust me." the boy said. "Nobody will have faith in me making those shots."

The boy was then quiet as he normally is. The night was without much sound other than the summer insects.

"Joe and coach had faith in you." said the man.

"How?"

"The coach drew that play and Joe passed the ball to you, didn't they?" said the man. "Seems like you are the only one that doesn't have faith in yourself."

"I had no idea if I could make it, I just let it fly." said the boy.

"Nobody knows if the ball is going in util it goes in, but it's not going in for sure unless someone shoot it." said the man. "You practised hard and well for it, might as well be you when the time comes."

"Then what if we then move to somewhere new. This will go back to where it was."

"Only next time you'll have some faith. You will know eventually you're going to make some shots and people will trust you with the ball." said the man. "Plus, we won't be moving like this forever. It's tough always be the newcomer, that I admit, but once this is finished, you'll be known as a shooter. People will have faith in you. You'll be the guy people pass to for the big shots."

The boy went silent, looking towards the sky. The man looked up, it was a night without stars.

"So what were you thinking when you caught the ball at the heating moment?" the man asked.

"I wasn't thinking much really."

"It was plenty of people and noise, little time left on the clock as well."

"I can't see them, I can't hear them." said the boy. "I just don't remember there was much when I got the ball."

"Did you feel like it's going in?"

"I don't know, but now that I think of it," said the boy. "It wasn't that different from the shots I take every morning."

"So, you were thinking: this is feeling good, it's going in."

"No, it was like I'm standing in this clean, well lighted place, all by myself."

"Solitary." Said the man.

"_Enlightened_" said the boy. "I think that's what they call it in the book"

Trying to catch some breeze, the boy stood up, so did the man.

"Want some ice cream now?" asked the man.

"They'll be bad for me."

"Drinking is bad, and you should never do it." said the man. "You could always have some ice cream, especially on a good day, or a really bad one."

"Like today." said the boy.

"You are young, hardworking and you can shoot pretty jump shots. With some faith and you could have anything. When all these moving around ends, everyday will be a good day." the man said. "Also, today _is_ a good day. I had a good day's work and you played a good game, made a good shot and your team won. We could have some ice cream for that."

"Are there any ice cream shop open? It's late."

"There must be. We will find it and have some ice cream. Tomorrow I will wake up the same way and work, you will wake up the same way and shoot. I know I would, I know you will." said the man. "I have faith in that."

"Come one, let's go get some ice cream." said the man, standing up, walking to his car.
