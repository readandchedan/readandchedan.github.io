A man and a boy walked out of the gym. It was dark and the night was tender. The day had been hot, humid and dusty but now things settled down and the air carried a sweet smell. It was late and every one had left. The gym was crowded but now without any man in sight but the man and the boy. They stopped in the shadow made by a tree with a electric light shone a gentle, orange light over it. In front of them here is a road, a car passed by and soon vanished. Then it was quiet.

"Want some ice cream?" the man asked.

"No."

"Why not, it's hot."

"I'm tired." said the boy. He sat down at the stairs and the man sat down with him.

"That was a good game." the man said.

"I guess."

"It was." said the man. "some real nice shots."

"Maybe One of them."

"No, one of them was _great_." answered the man.

"Just when did you arrive?"

"About 10 minutes left in the second half."

"Work?"

"Yeah, a lot of work." the man said. The boy could see the oil stains on him and smell the machines.

"At least you made it this time."

"Saw some good stuff too."

"Joe was pretty amazing."

"Wasn't the only good thing I saw."

"Those guys played well, they should have win."

"Well trained. With a little luck this could be a different story." said the man.

"They say Joe will make it to the NBA one day."

"Yeah, maybe. Special kid. Every other guy come to watch him." the man said.

"Coach said if we play defence, the game will take care of itself."

"And you think he meant _Joe_ would take care of the game." the man said to the boy."Well, he got it all wrong this time. _Someone else_ did." 

"It doesn't matter who made the shot, if it wasn't Joe no way that could happen." said the boy.

"A made shot is a made shot." said the man. "So what's like feel like catching it?"

"Just try to get it off."

"Yeah, plenty of people, plenty of noise, little time left on the clock. I would too." said the man. "How's making it feel?"

"Wasn't like what I thought. None of that exciting stuff on TV." said the boy. "It was like I'm standing in this clean, well lighted place, all by myself."

<!-- something here -->

"Solitary?"

"_Enlightened_" said the boy. "That's what they call it in the book" 

"That book you are reading?"

"_The Alchemist_."

"What was it about?"

"A kid following his dream, traveled around the world."

"Kinda like we do, just that none of us had any dreams to chance last time I check." said the man. "Just how many places we moved in the last few years?"

"First Castle in north California , then Ramstien in Germany, Atlus in Oklahoma, then Bentwaters in England." said the boy.

"Then back to California at Edward, then to here at Shaw." said the man. "Well, that's a lot of air bases. At least you are a big boy now. You can manage yourself."

"Maybe."

"You even took care of me." said the man. "You bought groceries this morning before you left to shoot, you even made me breakfast."

The boy smiled briefly and silently.

"All these moving around and working aren't easy and I appreciated the help." the man said. "How's your shooting this morning?"

"Usual."

"That's good."

"What is?"

"The shooting. You usually shot well don't you?"

"I guess."

"Were you thinking about making big shots tonight?"

"No." said the boy. "I didn't even know I would play."

"Of course you will."

"I'm new here, coach doesn't know me."

"You can play." said the man. "You should be ready for it."

"I just didn't know I _will_ play."

"If you worked for it then believe it." said the man. "Even you don't know for sure."

"But what's the difference?" the boy said. "Nobody would have faith in me."

"Joe and the coach did." said the man.

"How?" said the boy. "I guess Joe passed the ball and coach drew that play." he answered himself.

"Seems to me like you are the only one that doesn't have faith in yourself."

"I wasn't sure if I was suppose to take it." said the boy.

"Some one have to, might as well be you." said the man. "You wake up early every morning for it."

The boy then went quiet as he normally is, looking skyward. The man did too, it was a night without stars.

"What if we move again? Everything will come back to square one."

"Only next time you'll have faith, and you'll be known as a shooter." said the man. "People will trust you with the ball."

Trying to catch some breeze, the boy stood up, so did the man.

"Want some ice cream now?" asked the man.

"They'll be bad for me."

"Drinking is bad, and you should never do it." said the man. "You could always have some ice cream, especially on a good day, or a really bad one."

"Like today." said the boy.

"I had a good day's work and you played a good game, made a good shot. We could have some ice cream for that."

<!-- "You are a young, hardworking fellow and you can shoot pretty jump shots. Have some faith and you can have anything. All these moving days will be over, then everyday will be a good day." the man said. "Also, today _is_ a good day. I had a good day's work and you played a good game, made a good shot. We could have some ice cream for that." -->

"Are there any ice cream shop open? It's late."

"There must be. We will find it and have some ice cream. Tomorrow I will wake up the same way and work and you will wake up the same way and shoot. I know I would, I know you will. Then there will be more good days to come." said the man. "I have faith in that."

"Come on, let's go get some ice cream." said the man, standing up, walking to his car.
