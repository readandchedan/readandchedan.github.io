A man and a boy came out of a gym, it was late and every one had left. In the day time it was hot and humid and dusty but at night the air carried a sweet smell and things starts to settle down.

"Do you want some ice cream?" the man asked.

"No."

"What about a walk?"

"I don't want to. I'm tired." said the boy, as he sat down at the stairs. So the man sat down with him.

"That was a good game." the man said.

"I guess."

"It was, that I'm sure." said the man. "some real nice shots too."

"One of them, I guess."

"No, one of them was _especially_ nice." answered the man.

"Just when did you arrive?"

"About 10 minutes left in the second half."

"Work?"

"Yeah, a lot of work." the man said. The boy could see oil stains on the man and he could smell machines on him.

"At least you made it this time."

"Saw some good stuff too."

"Joe? He was pretty amazing."

"Wasn't the only good thing I saw."

"Those guys played well, they should have win."

"Some well trained kids, a little luck, the whole thing might end differently." said the man.

"They say Joe will be a star, may even play in the NBA one day."

"I'd believe that. He is a special kid. Everybody come to see him." the man said.

It was dark and the night was tender. The gym was crowded a while ago and was now completely empty without sight of a man. They sat in the shadow made by a tree with a eletric light shone a gentle, orange light. There was a road in front of them and a car passed by, soon vanished in the sight, and it was complete silence.

"Coach said if we play defence, the game will take care of itself."

"And you think he meant _Joe_ would take care of the game." the man said to the boy."Well, got it wrong this time. _Someone else_ took care of it." 

A brief smile appeared on the boy's face.

"How was that book you are reading?" asked the man.

"_The Alchemist_? I like it"

"Yes. What was it about?"

"A kid chasing his dream, traveled around the world ."

"Travel around the world, much like we do. Just how many places we moved in the last few years?"

"First north California at Castle, then Germany at Ramstien, Oklahoma at Atlus, then England at Bentwaters." said the boy.

"Then back to California at Edward, then to here at Shaw. That was a lot of air bases." said the man.

"After all those, you are a big boy and can manage yourself now."

"I'm not sure if I could."

"You even took care of me now." said the man. "You bought groceries this morning before you left to shoot, you even managed to made me breakfast."

The boy smiled silently, he always smiled silenlty.

"All these moving around and working aren't easy, I appreciated the help." the man said. "Did you shoot well this morning?"

"Usual."

"That's good."

"What is?"

"The morning shots. You usually shot well don't you?"

"I guess."

"Were you thinking you are going to make a big shot tonight? Like the one you just made?"

"No." said the boy. "I didn't even know I could play."

"Of course you will play, you practiced hard."

"I'm new here, the coach doesn't know what I do every morning."

"You praticed hard and you shoot well." asked the man. "Have some faith."

"But I didn't even _know_ I would play."

"That's why it's called faith." said the man. "It's believing it when you don't know for sure."

"How could I believe, if I do not know?"

"You shoot every morning, and you shoot well anywhere we go for as long as I can remember." said the man. "Nobody knows if the ball is going in util it goes in, but if you shoot every morning and you shoot well, you should believe it's going in."

"That's how what you do achieve beyond what you know." the man said. "What one could know is limited, while what one could do is boundless."

"Plus, Joe and coach had faith in you." said the man.

"How?" asked the boy.

"The coach drew that play and Joe passed the ball to you, didn't they?" said the man. "We all had faith in you, and you should too."

The night became very quiet, not much can be heard other than sound of the summer insects. The man look to the sky, it was a night without stars.

"So does it feel like catching the ball the heat of the moment like that?" can't seems to find any stars, the man then looked down and asked.

"Not much, really."

"That was a lot of people, a lot of noise and very little time."

Trying to recall the moment, the boy said: "It wasn't that different from any other shots in the morning. But somehow I felt the gym just wasn't there, the crowd wasn't there anymore. And when I shoot it, nobody else is on the court anymore. There was just me and basket. Then there's not even the basket. There was just me, and it was clear."

"Solitary." Said the man.

"I felt a lot of things, but then hardly anything at all." said the boy. "I think they called it _enlightened_ in the book".

The night got hotter. The boy stood up, trying to catch some breeze, so did the man.

"Want some ice cream now?" asked the man.

"I'm worried they'll be bad for me."

"Drinking is bad for you. When you had a especially good day, or a especially bad one, you could always have some ice cream" said the man.

"Like today." said the boy.

"You are young, hardworking and you can shoot pretty jump shots, with some faith and you could have anything. Everyday will be a good day." the man said. "Also, today _is_ a good day. I had a good day's work and you played a good game, made a good shot, and your team won. We could have some ice cream for that."

"Are there any ice cream shop open? It's late."

"There must be. We will find it and have ice cream. Tomorrow I will wake up the same way and work, you will wake up the same way and shoot. I know I would, I know you will." said the man. "I have faith in that."

"Come one, let's go get some ice cream." said the man, standing up, walking to his car.
